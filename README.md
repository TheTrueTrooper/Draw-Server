# Draw-Server
A sever/client drawing socket Programme thing I did for school

Actually two different projects. One was the client and one was the server. Both used sockets and a tranfer object lib.

The server would recive data from the client and send it to all other clients.

The client would take draw data and send it to the server. It would then render out all data received.
