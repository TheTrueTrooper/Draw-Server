# Draw-Server
A sever Client Group drawing thing i did for school

Actually two different projects. One was the client and one was the server. Both used sockets and a tranfer object lib.

The server would recive data from the client and project them to all other clients.

The client would take draw data ad send it to the server. Add I would rec them and render it out
